## Code Organisation

I was using this to play around with code organisation in Alpine.js

My goals:

* No bundling / transpiling of the code, just minification.
* Dynamically import the code for each component on the page.
* Use ES Module syntax for everything.
* Implement [Spruce](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/spruce).
