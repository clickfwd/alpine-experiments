## Toasts

This experiment showcases a global "toast" system, built using Alpine and Spruce.

**Things to look at**:

* All of the component declaration is done rather clearly in individual modules.
* This takes advantage of Spruce for managing the toasts at a global level.
* Alert styling with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com).
* Automatic dismissal of toasts using `setTimeout`.
* Optional dismissible button for each toast.
